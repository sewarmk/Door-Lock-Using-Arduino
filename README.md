# Door-Lock-Using-Arduino
Design of a door lock controlled via serial communication between two Ardunios

The system specified below is simulated with tinkercad. 

•	The user enters the three numbers  password into the first Arduino; use keypad to enter the password.

•	The password is serially transmitted into the other arduino.

•	If the password is true, the other arduino will turn on a green LED and control a servo motor to open a door, you don’t have to simulate the door, but we need to see the servo motor acting, and the LCD will display a comment showing that the password is correct!

•	If the password is wrong, the other arduino turns on a red LED, and the LCD will display a comment showing that the password is correct!

• If the password is wrong three times in sequence a buzzer is turned on.
